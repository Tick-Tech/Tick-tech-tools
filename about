Currently there is nothing to show. In the near future I will be adding tools I create.
The creation of these tools and such are a way for me to learn and express my ideas. 
The tools will be free to use all I ask is..

1: Give both positive and negative feedback. Sometimes negative feedback is more appreciative than positive.
2: Share with people 
3: If you find an issue or find that I have done something the wrong way let me know so I can fix it
4: Don't complain
